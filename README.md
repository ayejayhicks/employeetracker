## Challenges and Successes
Understanding file structure has been a challenge for me lately. To overcome this hurdle I revisit past assignments to try to understand the purpose of each file being used. Continuing into this week I broke each step of the ReadMe down and worked on one part of the assignment at a time. This helped with organization, processing and time management.  

## Technologies Used
Node.js  
Express.js  
Inquirer
MySQL  
Javascript
